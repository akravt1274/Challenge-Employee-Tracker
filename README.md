# Employee Tracker

## Description
In this challenge, I built a command-line application to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer to interact with a user via the command line, and PostgreSQL database to store data and perform various queries. Refer to the demonstration video posted in the [Review](#review).

- When starting the application, the user is presented with the following options: view all departments, view all roles, view all employees, add a department, add a role, add an employee, and update an employee role.

- When choosing to view all departments, the user is presented with a formatted table showing department names and department ids.

- When choosing to view all roles, the user is presented with the job title, role id, the department that role belongs to, and the salary for that role.

- When choosing to view all employees, the user is presented with a formatted table showing employee data, including employee ids, first names, last names, job titles, departments, salaries, and managers that the employees report to.
